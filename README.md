# cattusmanga_website
My 2022 school project. A manga website that would include a membership system. It includes some basic SQL and PHP CRUD, user moderation/management/administration tab, pointshop, customizable profiles, comment section, upload your own mangas tab, dark/light mode, cookies, and a great frontend made with js and bootstrap. 
This was a project I made to run locally and had no intention in making it larger or scale it, so keep in mind that it may not be optimized correctly for a larger userbase.


# How to run
Open XAMPP and start your Apache and MySql server, import the cattusmanga database stored in server folder. Finally copy it and access it at localhost/htdocs/cattusmanga_website
